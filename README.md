# searching-problems
- Searching is the process of finding a given value position in a list of values.
- It decides whether a search key is present in the data or not.
- It is the algorithmic process of finding a particular item in a collection of items.
- It can be done on internal data structure or on external data structure.

## Mainly two techniques available fot Searching
1. Sequential Search (Linear Search)
2. Binary Search

# 1. Linear Search
- It is an basic and simple search algorithm -- applied to search target item when the given list is an unsorted list. 
- Target element is compared sequentially with each element of a collection until it is found. Otherwise it will traverse through that list until it reaches to the end of the list.

## Time and Space Complexity :
- Best Time Complexity: O(1)
- Average Time Complexity: O(n)
- Worst Time Complexity:  O(n)
- Best Space Complexity: O(1)
